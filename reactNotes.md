ReactDom.render() vs js .append() method : ReactDom.render() is a function provided by react-dom which renders the elements and components in to react dom.It purpose is to render a React component into a specific Dom node. 

Reconcillation : when ReactDom.render() is called it creates in-memory tree in of React elements (Virtual Dom) That then it diffs with the previous rendered tree to compute the most efficient way to update the browser's DOM.

.append() method is used to insert a node or a string as the last child of a parent node . 

Why we use import react from 'react' ? 

React is what defines jsx .

Embedding expressions : Expression is a vaild piece of js code that resolves to get a value. embedding expressions are those expressions enclosed with in curly braces . It includes functions, variables ,calculations etc..

EG : interpolating text, conditional rendering etc

const name = 'Alice';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;


declarative VS imperative 

Declarative programming is a style where you write a code which specifies what you wanted to do, rather than how to do it. This mainly focus on the end result . In the context of react React's jsx you describe what the UI should look like for a given state ,and react take's care of rendering it. You don't manually manupulate the DOM.

imperative programming is a style of where you write code which specifies how to do what we wanted to do.It involves step by step instructions that change programms state.


Eg : It is the way of DOM manipulation using vanila javascript.

React Component : A component is considered as a core building block of react application .

completed topics + notes 

react - is a JavaScript library used for building and managing UI

components - components are the core concept in react. In react we split up the code into certain pieces and put into reusable component then the code become more readable and manageable.
             There are two types of components - functional components and class components  one is stateful component and other is stateless component. React Hooks are introduced to
             to manage state of components
JSX        - JavaScript XML is extended version of JavaScript with is used to include HTML inside JavaScript this is a way to write react . key features of JSX  is code readability, 		      Enhances 
                  productivity , babel transformation etc. babel is a transpiler which converts source code of one language to another

Pure Components - Are those components which does not re render's while the parent component renders. Pure components render only when there is change in state or props. for functional  
                  components pure components can be created by using react.memo() which is a higher order component.

Higher Order components - Are advanced patterns of react for reusing the component logic. They are a function that takes one component and gives out a new component essentially wrapping the
                  	  original component and provide additional functionality or data injection.

Virtual DOM vs Real DOM - Real DOM is a traditional DOM API provided by the browsers to represent the HTML Documents in a tree like structure allowing us to manipulate and access the                       			  document . virtual DOM is a light weight copy of the real DOM stored in the memory and is a representation of DOM elements as nodes in a tree structure.


Reconciliation - The process also known as diffing determines what has changed in the virtual Dom Then React update only those elements in the React DOM actually changed. 

Diffing Algorithm - This is an algorithm in react that used to change the real Dom according to the changes in the virtual Dom . 1st they identifies the changes and then it get updated in 
	            the real DOM.

strict Mode - This is a tool that used to highlighting the problems in an application in react. It does not have any impact in production build it checks are only run development mode.

Error Boundaries - These are react components that catch up JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of component tree crashed.

profiler - This is a performance measurement tool in react 16.5 which helps the developer to understand the errors in the applications. This can be used in both development and production 
	   production environment.

prop drilling - it is a common pattern in react that the one data that needs to pass to the other components through the other components . It is a difficult task . There comes the 			importance of context API and UseContext Context API is a feature of react that consider the data globaly that can be passed to the component tree. 


data flow in react - unidirectional data flow the data can be transferred from parent components to the child components through state and props.

limitations of react - prop drilling , no data fetch build in method in react , overrelay of virtual dom , third party dependencies.


fragments - it is a feature in react that helps to wrap up the child elements without adding a new node to the dom . 


SPA - single page applications interact with the user dianamically that it renders a particular section of the page without rerendering from the serverside.
